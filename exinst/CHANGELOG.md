# Version 0.8

* Builds with GHC 8.10 and `singletons-2.7`.

# Version 0.7

* BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE COMPILER ASSISTED CHANGE: All of the cabal flags
  for turning on and off instances were removed.  The `hashable` are now
  always exported from the `exinst`, and the `aeson`, `bytes`,
  `cereal` and `serialise` instances  are now exported from new
  packages `exinst-aeson`, `exinst-bytes`, `exinst-cereal` and
  `exinst-serialise`. The instances exported from those packages are
  the same as the ones exported with `exinst-0.6`.


# Version 0.6

* The `binary` and `deepseq` Cabal flags were removed since these two packages
  are always included with the GHC distribution, so it doesn't make sense to
  make them optional.

* The optional dependencies hidden behind Cabal flags now apply to the test
  suite as well.

* Builds with GHC 8.4.


# Version 0.5

* BREAKING: Depend on `singletons == 2.3.*`.

* Add `same{1,2,3,4}`.

* Add dependencies on `cborg` and `serialise`

* Add instances for `serialise` (binary CBOR encoding/decoding)


# Version 0.4

* BREAKING: Decouple `binary` and `cereal` instances from `bytes`. This
  introduces a slight backwards incompatible change if you were using some
  `Serial` instances that depended on host endianness (such as `Int`).

* Add `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4`.

* Add `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`.

* Add `Read` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}`.

* Moved documentation from `README.md` into the top-level `Exinst` module.


# Version 0.3.0.1

* Removed dependency on `generic-random`.

* Correctly deal with cabal flags for `deepseq` and `hashable`.

* Add `binary`'s `Data.Binary.Binary` and `cereal`'s `Data.Serialize.Serialize`
  instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}`. These instances are compatible with each other
  and rely on the `Data.Bytes.Serial` instances.


# Version 0.3

* BREAKING: Renamed module `Exinst.Singletons` to  `Exinst`.

* BREAKING: The `Exinst.Instances.Base` module is gone. The `base` instances are
  now exported from `Exinst`.

* Add `Dict0`.

* Re-export `Constraint` from `base`.

* Add `Dict{0,2,3,4}` instances for `Bool`.

* Add `GHC.Generics.Generic` support for `Some{1,2,3,4}`. This only works for
  indexes with `PEnum` and `PBounded` instances.

* Added tests.

* Added `Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in
  `Exinst.Instances.QuickCheck`. These instances and their dependency on
  `QuickCheck` can be toggled with the `quickcheck` Cabal flag.

* Added `Data.Aeson.{FromJSON,ToJSON}` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in
  `Exinst.Instances.Aeson`. These instances and their dependency on
  `aeson` can be toggled with the `aeson` Cabal flag. These instances used to
  exist in now-deprecated the `exinst-aeson` package, and are compatible with
  them.

* Added `Bytes.Serial.Serial` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in
  `Exinst.Instances.Bytes`. These instances and their dependency on `bytes` can
  be toggled with the `bytes` Cabal flag. These instances used to exist in
  now-deprecated the `exinst-bytes` package, and are compatible with them.

* Added `Control.DeepSeq.NFData` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in
  `Exinst.Instances.DeepSeq`. These instances and their dependency on `deepseq`
  can be toggled with the `deepseq` Cabal flag. These instances used to exist in
  now-deprecated the `exinst-deepseq` package, and are compatible with them.

* Added `Data.Hashable.Hashable` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in
  `Exinst.Instances.DeepSeq`. These instances and their dependency on `hashable`
  can be toggled with the `hashable` Cabal flag. These instances used to exist
  in now-deprecated the `exinst-hashable` package, and are compatible with them.


# Version 0.2

* Depend on `singletons-2.2`, which means `KProxy` is gone.

* Add `_Some{1,2,3,4}` prisms.

* Add `Dict1` instance for `Bool`.

* Add `some{1,2,3,4}SingRep`.

* Thanks to Sandy Maguire for having contributed to this release.


# Version 0.1.2

* Export the `Some{1,2,3,4}` constructors.

* Make all the fields in `Some{1,2,3,4}` strict.

* Relax upper bound on `base`, `singletons`, `constraints`.

* Re-export `Dict(Dict)` from `constraints`.


# Version 0.1.1

* Relax upper bound on `singletons` dependency.

* `withSome{1,2,3,4}Sing` brings `SingI` instances to scope.

* Generalized the `(* -> Constraint)` parameter in `Dict{1,2,3,4}`
  to `(k -> Constraint)`.


# Version 0.1

* Initial release.
