# Version HEAD

* Add `Dict0`.

* Re-export `Constraint` from `base`.

* Add `Dict{0,2,3,4}` instances for `Bool`.

* Added tests.

* Added `Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in

* Thanks to Sandy Maguire for having contributed to this release.


# Version 0.1.2

* Export the `Some{1,2,3,4}` constructors.

* Make all the fields in `Some{1,2,3,4}` strict.

* Relax upper bound on `base`, `singletons`, `constraints`.

# Version 0.1.1

* Relax upper bound on `singletons` dependency.

* `withSome{1,2,3,4}Sing` brings `SingI` instances to scope.

  to `(k -> Constraint)`.


# Version 0.1
